You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  It is:

Normally, we will remind you of your password once every month, although
you can disable this if you prefer.  This reminder will also include
instructions on how to unsubscribe or change your account options.
There is also a button on your options page that will email your current
password to you.
